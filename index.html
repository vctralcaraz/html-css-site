      <h2>Greetings</h2>
      <p>and a warm welcome to my captivating portfolio! 
        I am an aspiring web development programmer currently honing 
        my skills through the esteemed AppAcademy Open. As an 
        enthusiastic learner in this dynamic field, I find immense 
        joy in crafting digital experiences that seamlessly blend 
        functionality and aesthetics. My journey as a developer is 
        an ever-evolving quest, seeking to master the art of code to

      <h2>At Home</h2>
      <p>
        In addition to my passion for coding, my heart overflows with 
        love for my family. As a devoted family man, I cherish the 
        precious moments spent with my wife and our adorable 
        5-year-old son, eagerly awaiting the arrival of another bundle 
        of joy - another boy. Embracing fatherhood is an experience 
        that enriches my life, inspiring me to approach every challenge 
        with newfound determination and a sense of responsibility.
      </p>
